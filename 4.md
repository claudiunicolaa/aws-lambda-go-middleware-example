Now is time for production. It is a small and straightforward web app, so we take the decision to hosted via AWS Lambda.

First we will setup the stage for running on AWS Lambda the business logic.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events"
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
)

// the business logic
// we could imagine here is defined the codebase core capability
func handle(ctx context.Context, request events.APIGatewayProxyRequest) (events.APIGatewayProxyResponse, error) {
	return events.APIGatewayProxyResponse{
		Body:       "i'm an app",
		StatusCode: 200,
		Headers: map[string] string {
			"Content-Type":   "application/json",
		},
	}, nil
}

func main() {
	lambda.Start(handle)
}
```
For deploying and testing follow the AWS official [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-golang.html).
